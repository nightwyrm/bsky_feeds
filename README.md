# BlueSky Feeds
A repo of [BlueSky](https://bsky.app) feeds for transparency so that people can view the filters, and sharing so that people can federate the feeds i.e. create their own versions.

## Federating Instructions
To create your own version of one of these feeds:

1. Navigate to [SkyFeed](https://skyfeed.app) and log in (note: you will need to create an app password from Settings in BlueSky).
2. From the left-hand menu, select **Feed Builder**.
3. At the top-right of the **SkyFeed Builder** column, there will be a dropdown menu. Select **+ Create Feed** from there.
4. Select the **Switch to JSON Editor** option further down the column.
5. In the **JSON Editor** box, copy the JSON string from the relevant feed code in this repo.
6. Review the output in the **Feed Builder Preview** in the right-hand column.
7. Make any desired updates to the filters in either **JSON Editor** or **Visual Editor** mode.
8. Click on the **Publish Feed** button to bring up a form for adding an avatar, feed description, and desired license.
9. Complete and click on **Publish** to publish your feed.
10. Copy the **Published** URL from the top to share with others, or select the URL to take you to the published feed in BLueSky.
