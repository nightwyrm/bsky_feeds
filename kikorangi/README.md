# Kikorangi Feed
This is a reader-friendly view of the Kikorangi feed filters. Note: keywords are not case-specific.

## Included Keywords
The feed searches for these keywords in post text, URLs, and image alt-text. The feed also allows for where macrons have been omitted from kupu (except for Tāmaki which must use the macron to prevent nsfw anime content coming through).

The feed also excludes users specified within my own mute list. These are users that I think appear to be spammy, but I recommend adding your own list in here.
